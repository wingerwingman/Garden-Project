Usually after 3 years, the harvest period runs 8 to 10 weeks long. If the stalks become thin, stop harvesting; this means the plant's food reserves are low. Grab the base of the stalk and pull it away from the plant with a gentle twist. If this doesn't work, you can cut the stalk at the base. Be sure the discard of the leaves! Always leave at least 2 stalks per plant to ensure continued production. You may have a bountiful harvest for up to 20 years without having to replace your rhubarb plants.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

If you want small pumpkins, buy a small variety. A pumpkin is ripening when its skin turns a deep, solid color (orange for most varieties). When you thumb the pumpkin, the rind will feel hard and it will sound hollow. Press your nail into the pumpkin’s skin; if it resists puncture, it is ripe. To harvest the pumpkin, cut the fruit off the vine carefully with a sharp knife or pruners; do not tear. Be sure not to cut too close to the pumpkin; a liberal amount of stem (3 to 4 inches) will increase the pumpkin’s keeping time.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mTomatoes are America’s favorite garden vegetable. (Yes, we technically eat the fruit of the tomato plant, but it's used as a vegetable in eating and cooking and, thus, usually categorized in vegetables.) This vine plant is fairly easy to grow and will produce a bumper crop with proper care. Its uses are versatile, however, tomatoes are susceptible to a range of pests and diseases.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,

   [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mTomatoes can be either determinate(bush) or indeterminate(climbing) varieties. Determinate varieties can be grown without support, and they typically yield all of their fruit in the span of a few weeks. Indeterminate varieties should be staked, trellised, or caged, and pruned for optimal yields. They yield their fruit over a more extended time period. Tomatoes make great neighbors for basil plants in the garden.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,
